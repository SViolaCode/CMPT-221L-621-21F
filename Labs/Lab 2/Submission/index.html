Meoooow i will ruin the couch with my claws tickle my belly at your own peril i will pester for food when you're in the kitchen even if it's salad for fooled again thinking the dog likes me or hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away. Pee on walls it smells like breakfast hide head under blanket so no one can see scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food eats owners hair then claws head jump five feet high and sideways when a shadow moves for hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy claws in your leg. I will be pet i will be pet and then i will hiss fight own tail. Jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed.</p>
