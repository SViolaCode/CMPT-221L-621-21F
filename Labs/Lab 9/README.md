We talked about the steps that we could possibly take to deploy a website. I want you to think about the combination of those things that you would consider if you had to deploy your website. This is a good thinking exercise to do because you gain insight to what all of the different steps entail and are responsible for. Write out what parts you would use below and describe why. It doesn't have to be the most detailed but personally what would you want to do? (I'm not looking for perfect but it should be a working configuration. Assuming all of the website code is done. I don't need to hear about that unless its for the certificate or web server).

If I had to deploy a website I would do it though AWS. First I would have to make an account with Since im a beginner webiste developer I would use the free version before commiting the money to the pro version. I would use EC2 as the service for launching my website. This would give me an IP instead of a URL though, which I would have to register with a domain name provider. Once I have my key pair and public DNS registered I can run the DNS in the command prompt and launch the server.
